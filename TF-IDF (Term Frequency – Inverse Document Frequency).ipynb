    "- TF-IDF reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus\n",
    "- The tf–idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general\n",
    "- Term Frequency measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones.\n",
    "- TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document).\n",
    "- Inverse document frequency factor diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely.\n",
